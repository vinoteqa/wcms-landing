While global wine production continues to rise, consumption is declining. The [numbers speak for themselves](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/73965/umfrage/weinkonsum-pro-kopf-ausgewaehlter-laender-im-jahr-2007/#:~\:text=Die%20Weintrinker%2DNation%20Nummer%201,2023%20bei%20rund%20221%20Litern.): in countries with the highest per capita wine consumption ‚Äì including Italy, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ‚Äì there has been a noticeable decrease between 2022 and 2023. This trend clearly reflects the changing drinking habits in traditionally wine-loving nations.

One area that is gaining increasing importance is alcohol-free wine.

## **What‚Äôs happening in the market?**

Alcohol-free wines are no longer a niche but a growing market with significant potential. A study conducted by [Aret√® ](https://www.areteagrifood.com/)in 2023 shows that, despite its current small size, the market is growing rapidly ‚Äì with an average growth rate of 18% in the last two years. The European market for alcohol-free beverages is now worth 7.5 billion euros, with dealcoholized wine making up 322 million euros.

In Italy, the market is still small, with a turnover of 30 million euros, but a growth rate of over 20% per year is forecast. Health consciousness and changing consumption habits are driving this trend, which could soon make its way into many wine lists.

## **No alcohol, no wine?**

The legal classification of alcohol-free wines is key to their acceptance in the market.

In Germany, an alcohol-free drink can contain a maximum of 0.5% alcohol. In Italy, a drink could only be called "wine" if it contained at least 9% alcohol by volume. However, as of December 1, 2023, the EU has set new standards: dealcoholized wine can officially and legally be called wine. In Italy, it‚Äôs referred to as "vino dealcolato/dealcolizzato" or "vino parzialmente dealcolato."

Caution is necessary here, as dealcoholized wine may very well not always be completely alcohol-free (0.00%).

## **The difference from grape juice**

Alcohol-free wine often raises questions about whether it is truly wine or just grape juice. The answer lies in its production and the flavor profile.

Unlike grape juice, alcohol-free wine undergoes the full fermentation and aging process of regular wine before the alcohol is removed using special methods. This helps retain the complex aromas and bouquet notes.

The most common method for alcohol removal is vacuum distillation. In this process, the wine is gently heated under vacuum, which lowers the boiling point of alcohol to under 30¬∞C. This allows the alcohol to be removed without damaging the delicate aromas and flavors of the wine. To preserve quality further, these aromas are often reintroduced after the process.

A drawback of the method is the loss of liquid: about 15% of the total volume is lost during the process. However, the technology has made significant progress in recent years.

_Note: The Tyrolean startup_ [VINtech ](https://www.vintech.at/)_is working and experimenting with methods to better preserve aromas in dealcoholized wines and ensure the highest quality._

## **Can alcohol-free wine be flavorful?**

Taste remains a major point of criticism for alcohol-free wines, as alcohol is a key flavor carrier that provides body and structure to the wine. To compensate for this loss, aromatic grape varieties like Riesling are often used, which stand out with their intense fruit and acid notes. Alcohol-free wines also often contain more residual sugar, which can make them sweeter and less complex ‚Äì a compromise that doesn‚Äôt appeal to everyone.

What‚Äôs needed is a willingness and openness to explore new taste experiences with alcohol-free wines, finding the right options to complement a wine list.

## **A trend with potential**

The trend of alcohol-free wines is one that is gradually showing up on wine lists.

Although dealcoholized wines currently hold a small market share, they shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. After all, many consumers appreciate alcohol-free alternatives for various reasons ‚Äì whether for religious beliefs, personal choices, or the need to drive a car! Alcohol-free wine can be an exciting addition to any wine list.

**Cheers!** üç∑
