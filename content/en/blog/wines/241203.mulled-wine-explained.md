Mulled wine is a staple of the cold season. On Christmas markets, its scent of cinnamon, cloves, and orange peel draws people in like magic. Yet, while many see it as a symbol of coziness, it also sparks debates. What‚Äôs behind this winter classic, and why do some wine enthusiasts look at it critically?

## **What is Mulled Wine, exactly?**

By definition, mulled wine is a hot beverage based on wine, flavored with sugar and winter spices like cinnamon, cloves, star anise, and citrus fruits. Laws in countries like Germany regulate its production strictly. Mulled wine must be made exclusively from wine, without the addition of spirits, liqueurs, or colorants. Likewise, it cannot be diluted with water. The alcohol content must range between 7% and 14.5%.

The tradition of spiced wine dates back to ancient times. The Romans enjoyed _Conditum Paradoxum_, a wine enhanced with honey and exotic spices. Over the centuries, this idea evolved into the mulled wine we know today.

## **Mulled Wine doesn‚Äôt have to be red**

Traditionally, mulled wine is made from red wine. Full-bodied, fruit-forward varieties like Merlot are particularly suitable, as they complement the strong spices. In recent years, white mulled wine has gained popularity, especially in Austria. This version often uses acidic grape varieties like Riesling, M√ºller-Thurgau, or Gr√ºner Veltliner, which add a fresh note to the blend of citrus and spices.

Regional preferences also play a role in mulled wine‚Äôs variety. In South Tyrol or Trentino, Lagrein is often used, while in Emilia-Romagna, Sangiovese ‚Äì known for its bold character ‚Äì serves as the base wine. Regardless of whether red or white, one thing is clear: the quality of the base wine matters. High-quality wines create a harmonious beverage, while cheap bulk wines often result in overly sour or unbalanced drinks.

## **Beware of overheating**

A common mistake in preparing mulled wine is overheating. The ideal temperature lies between 70¬∞C and 78¬∞C ‚Äì hot enough to release the aromas but not so hot that the alcohol evaporates.

Overheating not only diminishes the taste but also reduces the effect. For those preparing it at home, slow warming with regular stirring is key. Precise temperature control devices are especially helpful for achieving the perfect serving temperature.

## **Criticism of Mulled Wine ‚Äì Too much sugar, too much powder**

As beloved as mulled wine is, it has its detractors. Many wine enthusiasts criticize that the delicate nuances of the wine are masked by sugar and spices. This critique is particularly aimed at commercial products, which are often overloaded with artificial flavors, excessive sugar, and sometimes cheap spice powders.

These pre-mixed spices, while convenient and cost-effective, significantly reduce the quality of the mulled wine. Fresh ingredients like cinnamon sticks, cloves, or orange peels are a far superior choice. Self-dosing the spices also allows better control over the balance of sweetness and spice.

## **Between Tradition and Enjoyment**

Mulled wine is a drink with a long history and multifaceted character. From Roman times to modern Christmas markets, it has maintained its popularity, even achieving a near-cult status in many countries. Properly prepared, using high-quality wine and fresh spices, it is far more than just "sugary wine."

Whether red or white, mulled wine not only warms us in the cold season but also brings the taste of Christmas to our glass. While it may not be everyone‚Äôs favorite, it remains an indispensable part of winter culture.

**Cheers!** üç∑
