The term Millésime might sound like a technical expression to many, but it hides a fascinating concept: a vintage wine that captures the uniqueness of a specific year. Particularly in Champagne, but also in other sparkling wines, Millésime holds a special significance. But what exactly does it mean?

## **What Does Millésime Mean?**

The term Millésime comes from French and simply means “vintage.” It refers to a sparkling wine made exclusively from the grapes of a specific harvest year. Unlike Non Millésimé – which is blended from multiple vintages – a Millésime reflects the climatic and geological conditions of a single year. The concept is particularly important in the French wine region of Champagne.

Such vintage Champagnes, however, are not produced every year but only under exceptional conditions.

## **When Is a Millésime Champagne Produced?**

In Champagne, several criteria must be met for a year to be declared a Millésime. These include the following three main factors:

- **Exceptional climatic conditions**
- **The cellar master’s decision**
- **Limited production**

For a Millésime to come into existence, the specific year must allow for optimal ripening of the grapes – with a balance of acidity and sugar content. Frost, hail, or rain at the wrong time can jeopardize the entire harvest.

The decision as to whether a year “deserves” to be bottled as a Millésime lies in the hands of the cellar master. Often, the winemakers of a house deliberate internally, or a panel of experts decides. In all cases, Millésime must, according to EU regulations, contain at least 85% of the corresponding vintage. However, the French CIVC (Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne) has raised this percentage to 100%.

An interesting fact: even in a Millésime year, only a portion of the harvest is used for vintage Champagne. The majority of the grapes are still reserved for Non Millésimé Champagne, as these form the foundation of the house’s consistent style.

## **What Makes Millésime Champagne So Special?**

A vintage, or Millésime, is not declared every year. It is reserved for special harvest years in which the grapes achieve outstanding quality and ripeness. This makes vintage Champagnes rarer and often more prestigious.

A Millésime Champagne represents the identity and uniqueness of its year. This is reflected in its taste:

- **Complexity:** Vintage Champagnes are characterized by deeper aromas and a pronounced structure.
- **Individual style:** Each bottle is a time capsule, reflecting the conditions of its respective year – be it a hot, dry summer or a cool, rainy autumn.
- Greater aging potential: Due to their concentration and structure, Millésime Champagnes are often better suited for long-term aging than their Non Millésimé counterparts.

## **Non Millésimé: The Constant in the World of Champagne**

While a Millésime is the exception, Non Millésimé is the backbone of Champagne production. Non Millésimé, also known as Sans Année (no vintage), is composed of base wines from various years. The focus here is on consistency: regardless of weather conditions or grape quality in a specific year, the taste should align with the house’s typical style.

### **How Does It Work?**

- Cellar masters blend wines from several vintages, often supplemented by so-called Vins de Réserve, reserve wines from previous harvests.
- These reserve wines can be 5 to 10 years old and add additional complexity and depth to the Champagne.
- The goal is to create a harmonious, versatile wine that consistently meets customers’ expectations.

## **Is Millésime Exclusive to Champagne?**

Although the term Millésime is closely associated with Champagne, it is also used for other sparkling wines. In Italy, for example, a vintage Prosecco or Franciacorta made mostly from the grapes of a single harvest is referred to as Millésimato. Spanish Cavas or German Sekts can also be vintage wines.

However, there are differences: while Champagne has strict regulations regarding when a vintage can be declared, the criteria in other sparkling wine regions are often less stringent. Nonetheless, the core idea remains the same: vintage wines represent a special year, both in the glass and in character.

## **Why Is This Topic Significant?**

For wine lovers, understanding Millésime offers an opportunity to explore the world of Champagne on a deeper level. It provides the chance to experience the diversity of individual vintages and understand how climate, terroir, and craftsmanship come together. At the same time, Millésime is a selling point: vintage Champagnes are considered particularly high-quality and are often marketed as prestige products.

The term Millésime may seem simple, but it represents the essence of an extraordinary year. Every Millésime tells its own story.

**Cheers! 🍷**
