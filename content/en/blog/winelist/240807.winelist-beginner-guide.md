A well-structured wine list not only helps guests choose the right wine but is also often the heart of an establishment, through which wine collections are optimally presented.

## Designing a Wine List

A wine list should always be tailored to the specific establishment.

The format is an interesting starting point. Wine lists do not have to be in the classic A4 format, as is the case in many places. The format of the wine list can and should vary; whether that's by choosing A3 or other formats. This allows establishments to stand out. Another important decision is the material of the wine list. From elegant leather to modern plastic, there are many options that match the style of an establishment.

When guests open a wine list, they are greeted by colors, images, logos, fonts, and sizes, as well as design elements such as labels or certifications. It is important that the wine list aligns with the style of the establishment's communication, ensuring a cohesive appearance.

## Structure of a Wine List

A consistent structure is important for both guests and sommeliers and service staff. Many establishments use the first pages to describe the philosophy of their wine cellar. Various labels or certifications are often explained in detail. In other lists, the first wines are listed immediately.

Once it comes to the wines, Vinoteqa recommends a consistent approach:

- Table of Contents
- Champagne (optional)
- Sparkling Wines
- Ros√© Wines
- White Wines
- Red Wines
- Sweet Wines
- Fortified Wines
- Additional category for large bottles (optional)

This structure allows guests to explore the wine list according to their preferences. Wines are usually grouped by winery or grape variety. Guests often decide based on their preferences, not necessarily the names of the wines. Additionally, it is advisable to prioritize a certain region of origin. For example, if a restaurant is in Italy, it makes sense to start with Italian wines.

## Essential Wine Information

What information is really important for a wine list?

The [Vinoteqa](/en) team, in collaboration with international sommelier associations, conducted a survey to identify preferences.

Here are the most important details:

- Country or region of origin
- Area of origin
- Price
- Wine style
- Vintage
- Grape varieties
- Alcohol content
- Denomination
- Bottle size

In recent years, information about various labels, especially for organic, biodynamic, or natural wines, has become increasingly important. Design elements are often used to provide additional information and transparency to guests.

## Updating the Wine List

A crucial task for every sommelier is to keep the wine list up to date. Guests are particularly disappointed when they order a wine that is no longer available. It is the establishment's responsibility to avoid such inconveniences. This task is essential but time-consuming: regular inventory checks, updating the wine list, formatting the new list, etc. Seasonal adjustments or weekly lists are also often added. Generally, not all wines are included in the list, especially rare and premium wines.

[Vinoteqa](/en) offers a tailored solution to automate and digitalize the creation of wine lists. Through its platform, Vinoteqa allows restaurant owners to save time, enabling sommeliers to focus on the most important element: the guest.
