Wine classifications on wine labels and wine lists are not merely formal details; they provide valuable information about the origin, quality, and production of wines.

## **The Beginnings of Wine Designations**

For centuries, there were no uniform quality standards for wine. The lack of regulations led to frequent wine adulteration, and false claims were often made. This situation was particularly widespread in the 19th century when industrially produced wines with additives and fake origin designations entered the market.

In the 1930s, France became the first country to introduce a system for quality classification, ensuring regulated classifications. Italy followed in the 1960s with new classifications for Italian wines, and soon Spain and Portugal also introduced legal standards for wine classifications, which to this day guarantee quality and authenticity.

## **What Do the Classifications Really Mean?**

The classifications on the wine label or wine list are much more than just names or symbols. They are an indicator of the origin and quality of a wine and ensure that certain production standards have been met. In the EU, wines are legally divided into different quality levels, which, however, do not necessarily reflect taste but rather the origin and cultivation methods.

## **A Look at Italy**

In Italy, for example, there is a precise classification system that divides wine into different categories. These range from less restrictive classifications like IGT (Indicazione Geografica Tipica) to stricter classifications like DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) and DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita).

- **IGT**: Wines come from specific geographical regions but are not as strictly regulated as DOC or DOCG wines. They allow winemakers greater freedom to experiment with grape varieties and cultivation methods. IGT is considered equivalent to the French ‚ÄúVin de Pays‚Äù and requires that at least 85% of the grapes come from a specific location.
- **DOC**: wines are subject to specific production norms that guarantee the origin and quality of the wine. These norms clearly define which grape varieties may be used, how the wine is produced, and where it is harvested. DOC wines must come from a clearly defined area and meet strict requirements, including maximum yield limits per grape variety (measured in quintals per hectare) and minimum natural alcohol content.
- **DOCG:** is the highest quality level and is only awarded to wines that have been certified as DOC for at least ten years and have undergone even stricter quality controls. Many of the most renowned Italian wines, such as Chianti Classico (Tuscany) or Barolo (Piedmont), are DOCG wines.

These classifications not only provide information about a wine's origin but also about the methods and structures behind its production.

_Did you know? Approximately 98.8% of South Tyrol's total vineyard area is under DOC protection._

## **Parallels with Germany**

Germany also has a similar classification system that categorizes wines by quality and origin. From ‚ÄúLandwein‚Äù to ‚ÄúQualit√§tswein‚Äù to ‚ÄúPr√§dikatswein,‚Äù these designations help distinguish wines and ensure compliance with established standards. A detailed explanation of the German classifications can be found in this [blog article](https://www.vinoteqa.com/en/blog/wines/german-riesling).

## **A Tour through Europe**

Other European countries also have their own classification systems, aligned with EU guidelines. On French wines, the designation ‚ÄúAOC‚Äù for ‚ÄúAppellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e‚Äù is common. Spanish wines, on the other hand, are often labeled ‚ÄúDenominaci√≥n de Origen‚Äù (DO). Portugal, like Italy, also uses a designation called ‚ÄúDenomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada‚Äù (DOC).

These classifications not only offer transparency to consumers and guests but also guarantee the origin, quality, and authenticity of a wine.

## **The Importance of Designations**

The classifications on wine labels and wine lists are not only legal requirements but also an important quality feature for certain wine enthusiasts, guaranteeing both the origin and quality of the wine.

In a world where quality and origin are gaining increasing importance, these classifications are indispensable for every wine lover‚Äîeven on the [wine list](https://www.vinoteqa.com/en#winelist:~\:text=Your%20Personalized%20Wine%20List).
