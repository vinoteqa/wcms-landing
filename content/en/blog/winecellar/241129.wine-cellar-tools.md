Managing wine doesn’t have to be complicated. Whether you’re a hotel/restaurant owner or a wine lover, having the right tools can make all the difference. From keeping track of your bottles to knowing when they’re at their best, the right platform can help you stay organized and enjoy your collection to the fullest—whether it’s for your guests or a special occasion.

## Private Wine Collectors

Managing a private wine collection can be much easier with the right tools. Here’s a look at three of the most popular platforms designed to help wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs organize their cellars, track bottle maturity, and make the most of their collection:

### **InVintory**

InVintory is great for private wine collectors who like a visual and organized way to manage their cellar. You can quickly get started by importing data from tools like CellarTracker or manually adding wines by scanning labels or searching the database. While the platform offers a lot of options, the setup process can be quite detailed and take up a lot of time. Also, not all of the wines in the database have reliable data points (grapes, alcohol, etc.).

You’ll spend time arranging your bottles into a 3D digital layout, organizing them by location, and even creating sections, rows, and columns. While it takes effort, the end result is a very organized and visually appealing cellar that makes it easy to locate bottles and keep track of your collection. One feature that particularly stands out is InVintory’s AI sommelier Vincent, that can give you thoughtful recommendations and further wine information.

InVintory comes in three packages:

- Aspire, for the new collector (free version)
- Premium, for the experienced collector ($124.99/year)
- Opus, for the elite collector (price on request)

Who it’s for: While InVinotory does offer solutions for businesses as well, it’s mainly designed for collectors with large or complex inventories who don’t mind putting in time for detailed setup. Explore the tool and all its features [here](https://invintory.com/).

### **Oeni**

Oeni combines inventory tracking with a focus on wine maturity and value. The app acts as your personal sommelier, analyzing your wine cellar and telling you when to open your bottles at their peak. With access to over 40,000 wines in their database, you can add bottles to your virtual cellar by scanning labels or entering details manually, similar to InVintory. The platform lets you design your own 3D cellar layout, specifying rack sizes, heights, and widths.

While the setup process requires a significant investment of time, it can pay off by helping you monitor not just what you have, but also its financial value and when each bottle is reaching peak maturity. Oeni will also allow you to discover fitting food and wine pairings with over 5,000 dishes.

Oeni comes in two packages:

- Oeni Freemium (free version)
- Oeni Plus (€79.99/year)

Who it’s for: Collectors who value financial insights and peak drinking guidance for their collection. Explore the tool and all its features [here](https://oeni.app/en/).

### **Vivino**

Vivino is already well-known for its wine discovery and label-scanning features, but it also offers a digital cellar tool. You can scan labels to add wines to your collection. While it’s a convenient tool for casual collectors already using Vivino, ads in the free version and limited cellar functionality without Premium might frustrate serious collectors.

In order to enjoy the benefits of managing your wine collection through Vivino, you need to be a Premium user. Then you could start discovering detailed drinking windows for the wines in your cellar, statistics on your wine collection value, personalized food and wine pairings and more.

Vivino comes in two packages:

- Vivino Freemium (free version)
- Vivino Premium (€47.90/year)

Who it’s for: Casual wine enthusiasts looking for a simple way to keep track of their collection within an app they already use for wine reviews. Explore the tool and all its features [here](https://www.vivino.com/EN/en).

## Professional Solutions for Restaurants, Hotels and Wine Bars

Managing a wine cellar in a restaurant or hotel isn’t just about keeping track of bottles—it’s about creating a seamless experience for both staff and guests. A well-organized system ensures that inventory is accurate, wine lists are up-to-date and visually appealing, and service runs smoothly.

The right tools can transform how wine is managed, making it easier to stay on top of stock, present wines in a way that excites customers, and even streamline processes like tracking purchases or sales. For sommeliers and managers, it’s not just about efficiency—it’s about enhancing the entire wine experience, from the cellar to the table. Discover some of the best solutions for your professional wine cellar.

### **Enoweb**

Enoweb is a comprehensive tool for managing wine cellars and creating digital wine lists. The tool is mostly used for medium and high-end restaurants and groups in Italy for digital wine lists and wants to help restaurants keep everything under control while linking wine cellar inventories with wine lists in real time.

With access to a database of 273,000 wine labels, Enoweb simplifies inventory management thanks to a barcode-scanner, even if there are multiple cellars. With the help of these scanners, restaurants can add stickers to every bottle of wine and scan them before serving the wine at a table, therefore keeping inventory under control. Enoweb also helps automating pricing calculations for both bottles and glasses. Its digital wine cellar feature allows restaurants to organize and maintain their wine inventory with precision.

While Enoweb offers robust functionality, the user interface could benefit from modernization to enhance usability. Additionally, adding new wines to the database can take time if they are not already included, which may require extra effort for restaurants managing diverse inventories.

### **Winepad**

Winepad is a tool originally from Austria that focuses on integrating wine cellar management with an immersive wine list creation tool, allowing customers to add detailed data points and images to their digital wine lists. Restaurants can also generate printable wine lists with Winepad.

The database includes 88,000 wines and Winepad allows restaurants to synchronize Winepad data (such as article number, price, quantity,etc.) with other systems via Excel tables. Purchases and cellar outgoings can be tracked with a few clicks and entered in real time during service. Winepad is a platform that aims to connect hotel guests directly with wine producers, letting them purchase their wines while tasting them in the restaurant or hotel. 

Winepad also includes tools for price calculation and a wine lexicon available in different languages. The main concern of the platform is to create the perfect sales-promoting presentation of a restaurants entire F\&B offer.

### **Vinoteqa**

Vinoteqa is tailored exclusively for restaurants, hotels, and wine bars, making it an interesting solution for managing large wine cellars with 300 or more labels. Its web-based platform is designed to save time, improve service, and increase revenue.

With access to a comprehensive database of over 1.3 million wines from 120,000+ wineries, Vinoteqa simplifies wine list creation and more. Both digital and printable lists can be generated in just a few clicks, helping establishments present their collections professionally. Inventory management is at the platform’s core, allowing users to add purchases and sales either manually or automatically through integration with existing systems.

## What’s best for you?

Private wine collection tools, such as InVintory, Oeni, and Vivino, excel at offering personalized experiences for individual collectors, prioritizing features like peak maturity tracking, AI-driven recommendations, and visually organized cellar layouts. However, they fall short in addressing the operational complexities of professional environments. These tools typically lack capabilities for real-time inventory tracking across multiple users, automated pricing calculations, and seamless integration with broader systems like point-of-sale (POS) or barcode scanning for efficient service.

On the other hand, professional tools like Enoweb, Winepad, and Vinoteqa are built to handle the demands of high-volume, multi-user environments. They prioritize streamlined inventory management, wine list creation, and customer engagement. While these tools are ideal for restaurants, hotels, and wine bars, they often forgo the more personalized or visual features valued by private collectors, focusing instead on operational efficiency and service enhancement. This specialization makes each type of tool better suited to its intended audience, but less effective outside its domain.

## How do you manage your wine cellar?

Whether you’re managing a personal collection or operating a professional wine cellar, having a dedicated system is invaluable. It improves organization, saves time, and enhances the overall experience, ensuring your wines are always at their best—ready to delight private collectors and customers alike. The right tool depends on individual needs, but all offer significant benefits for wine management.
