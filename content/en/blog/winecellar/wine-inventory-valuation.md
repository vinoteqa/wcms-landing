## **How You Should Calculate the Value of Your Wine Inventory (and Why FIFO Is the Right Choice)**

Managing a wine cellar isn’t just about knowing what’s on the shelves — it’s also about understanding what your inventory is *really worth*.

In times of inflation, price changes, and shifting vintages, the way you calculate the value of your wine stock can dramatically affect how you set prices, track margins, and plan purchases.

So how *should* you calculate it? Let’s break it down.

### **Why Wine Inventory Valuation Matters in Hospitality 🍷**

If you run a restaurant, wine bar, or hotel, your wine cellar is one of your most valuable assets. But its value isn’t static.

Prices change every time you reorder. Suppliers update vintages. And in today’s world, inflation quietly increases the replacement cost of every bottle.

If your inventory valuation doesn’t reflect those changes, your reports will look profitable - but your margins might already be shrinking.

That’s why choosing the right **inventory calculation method** matters more than it might seem.

### **The Main Inventory Calculation Methods ⚙️**

There are **three main approaches** used across industries: 

- FIFO
- LIFO
- Average Cost

Let’s see what each means in plain language.

#### **FIFO (First In, First Out)**

The bottles you **buy first** are considered the **first ones sold**. This mirrors how most restaurants naturally rotate their stock: older vintages are sold before newer ones.

#### **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**

The opposite of FIFO. It assumes the **newest stock** is sold first. While sometimes used in accounting to reduce taxes in inflationary periods, it doesn’t reflect how wine cellars operate in reality.

#### **Average Cost**

Takes the **average** of all purchase prices, smoothing out fluctuations. This can work for generic goods — but wine, with its changing vintages and variable pricing, needs more precision.

### **Why FIFO Is the Best Choice for Wine Management 💡**

In the real world, where wine bottles and prices are subject to inflation, FIFO provides the most accurate and realistic picture of your margins.

Here’s why:

- Older stock is valued at older (cheaper) prices.
- Newer purchases reflect the current, often higher, cost.
- Your statistics show slightly lower margins — but that’s correct, because your replacement cost is now higher.

With FIFO, you **see the true profitability** of your wine sales. It doesn’t exaggerate your margins; it shows what they really are.

In other words, FIFO helps you plan your pricing strategy with clarity and fairness.

### **How Vinoteqa Handles Inventory Valuation 🧾**

In **Vinoteqa**, every wine entry includes a field called **Purchase Price**. This value is **manually editable** — but it acts only as a **fallback**.

#### **🔍 What Does “Fallback Purchase Price” Mean?**

Vinoteqa uses this fallback purchase price **only when no purchase orders are available** for that specific wine.

- You just added a new wine to your digital cellar but haven’t yet recorded any purchase order for it.
- Vinoteqa doesn’t have historical data to calculate FIFO cost.

In this case, the system temporarily relies on the **manual purchase price** you entered. Once you add purchase orders, Vinoteqa automatically switches to using **FIFO-calculated prices** based on those orders.

That’s why it’s so important to **record purchase orders** consistently: they ensure your stock value, suggested prices, and profitability metrics are all accurate.

### **🍇 Why Updating Vintages Is Essential**

Wine is a living product — and every vintage is different, both in **taste** and **value**.

When your supplier delivers a new vintage, it’s not enough to just change the label in your list:

- The **body and character** of the wine change.
- The **economic value** changes.
- The **price** you pay (purchase price) likely changes too.

If you don’t update the vintage in your wine list and in your management system, you risk showing inaccurate prices and misleading stock reports.

That’s why systems like **Vinoteqa** encourage updating vintages regularly — so your digital cellar always matches the real one.

### **📊 The Pros and Cons of Other Methods**

| Method       | Pros                                                                     | Cons                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FIFO         | Reflects real stock flow, accurate margins, ideal for wine               | Margins appear lower during inflation (but that’s the truth) |
| LIFO         | Can reduce taxable profit (theoretical benefit)                          | Unrealistic for wine cellars, distorts inventory value       |
| Average Cost | Simpler to manage, only works with prices that have not a lot of changes | Hides real cost variations, inaccurate for changing vintages |

### **The Bottom Line ✅**

If you manage a restaurant or wine bar, **FIFO is the most transparent and reliable way** to calculate your wine inventory’s value.

It mirrors how bottles actually move through your cellar, prevents misleading profit figures, and aligns perfectly with real-world stock flow.

**Vinoteqa** follows this logic automatically:

- Uses FIFO for all stock and margin calculations.
- Falls back to the manual “Purchase Price” only if no purchase orders exist.
- Updates prices dynamically as soon as new purchase data becomes available.

So when you see that tooltip saying:

“This is the fallback purchase price. Read how Vinoteqa handles stock value you now know exactly what it means.

**In short:**

➡️ FIFO = fair, realistic, and ideal for wine.

➡️ Always register purchase orders for accurate data.

➡️ Update vintages to reflect both taste and value changes.

Because true wine management isn’t just about what’s in the bottle — it’s about knowing what it’s worth.

**—**

**Vinoteqa** helps restaurants and hotels digitize their wine cellars, automate wine list creation, and keep inventory accurate in real time.

Your wine cellar, always in your pocket. 🍷
